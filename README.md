# BroloGuard

Budgeted, auditable signal pipeline for OpenClaw agents.

**Security:**
- Do **not** commit secrets. Put keys in environment variables or local `.env` files that are gitignored.
- This repo is intended to be safe-by-default: strict spend caps, endpoint allowlists, and an audit log of decisions.

Status: hackathon build (USDC/OpenClaw).
